## Reporting a Flagged Email


When a flagged email is found, users will see a button to **"Report"**. Clicking this button will initiate a report.


The report will automatically include the entire chat history associated with the flagged email. This is to provide full context for our review team.

## New User Registration


During the registration process, a warning will be displayed to new users. This warning will state:


**"Warning: This website has received [number] red reports from users."**


The number of red reports will be dynamically updated based on the current count.
